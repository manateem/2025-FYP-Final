[Decision] Combine our previous mandatory assignment groups' manually-annotated datasets into one large dataset, and drop the group_id column -> 400 images lots of data; the values for each are already group consensus between 5 people, no need to add 2 more people for each for the members who were not in that particular group
[Decision] Put the logbook full of decisions on the Github because decisions are usually made as a group and logs are usually fixed and static with only additions needed; this is compared to Overleaf which may be more confusing; to put things all in one place.
[Decision] Every meeting we congregate to discuss what we've done, review each other's work, and decide where to go from here. Then we add all our new tasks to the todo.md file. Then from here we can split up work and do the tasks individually, then repeat, meeting regularly.
