[Decision] Combine our previous mandatory assignment groups' manually-annotated datasets into one large dataset, and drop the group_id column -> 400 images lots of data; the values for each are already group consensus between 5 people, no need to add 2 more people for each for the members who were not in that particular group
[Decision] Put the logbook full of decisions on the Github because decisions are usually made as a group and logs are usually fixed and static with only additions needed; this is compared to Overleaf which may be more confusing; to put things all in one place
